# Overview

This repository contains an R package (temor) and its associated function (OR_95CI) to provide users with a simple method to obtain odds ratios and confidence intervals, provided that the beta coefficients and standard errors from regression outputs are known. In addition, the confidence intervals are customizable based on the significance level set in the function. Users can also set their own rounding options, making the output easily adaptable for reporting or publication. Instructions for how to use the function can be obtained from the help documentation once the package is installed in R.
